# Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

To use this project, you need to follow the commands below:

1. Clone the repository into your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/ibrahimelmokhtar/js-sample-weather-app.git`

3. Open the local website on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`  

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)  
In this section, I will explain **how the code works** and **how everything is put together.**  

## Interface and Architecture
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
### Architecture
This project has the structure shown below:  
```
node_modules
website
  - assets
  - css
    -- responsive-tablets.css
    -- responsive.css
    -- styles.css
  - js
    -- app.js
  - index.html
package.json
README.md
server.js
```

### Usability
  This website has a Responsive Design. This means: "All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers."  


## Weather App Behavior
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
### 1. Zip Code Coordinates
The user is able to enter a specific zipcode, then the website will use this zipcode to fetch weather data from [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/current) using a URL similar to `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip={zip}&appid={API key}&units=imperial`.

### 2. Handle User Feelings
The website can handle the user feelings and display them, or hide them if the user did NOT enter anything. 

### 3. Weather API Data
The Web API will return an object contains key/value pairs, but I used the following highlighted ones ONLY. 
```
{
  ...
  "weather": [
    {
      ...
      "description": "clear sky",    ðŸ‘ˆ 
      "icon": "01d"   ðŸ‘ˆ 
    }
  ],
  "base": "stations",
  "main": {
    "temp": 282.55,   ðŸ‘ˆ 
    ...
  },
  ... ,
  "dt": 1560350645,   ðŸ‘ˆ 
  "sys": {
    ...
    "country": "US",    ðŸ‘ˆ 
    ...
  },
  ...
  "name": "Mountain View",    ðŸ‘ˆ 
  "cod": 200    ðŸ‘ˆ 
  }                                             
```
### 4. Display Basic Obtained Result
The website displays the following items as a search result:
1. Weather Temperature in Fahrenheit.
2. Current Date.
3. User Feelings.


## Additional Features
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
### 1. Latitude and Longitude Coordinates
The user is able to enter a specific latitude and longitude coordinates, then the website will use these coordinates to fetch weather data from [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/current) using a URL similar to `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}&units=imperial`.

### 2. Current Location
The website can use the user's current location to find latitude and longitude coordinates, then use these coordinates to fetch weather data using latitude/longitude method.

### 3. Selection of Temperature Degree
The user is able to choose between (Fahrenheit degree) and (Celsius degree) to display the obtained temperature value. 

### 4. Display More Information
The website displays the following additional items along with the search result:
1. [Weather Condition Icon](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions): by fetching a specific image using URL similar to `https://openweathermap.org/img/wn/{icon}@2x.png`.
2. Weather Temperature in Celsius, when selected.
3. Weather Condition Description.
4. City, Country Names.
